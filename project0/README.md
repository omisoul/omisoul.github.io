# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I decided to do a web page based on basketball for project 0.
I've always been a fan of basketball and this was a great way to mix two of my passions.

index.html - This page contains a short description of my journey playing basketball.
history.html - This page give a short summary of the history of basketball as well as its inventor
players.html - This page contains my favourite plays and their statistics,
highlights.html - This oage contains some of my favourite highlights from Youtube.

In this project I used a timeline designed by https://bootsnipp.com/mylastof*/ in history.html
There are comments to indicate the start and end of this code.
